Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. How do I restore my PRO purchase?

If you have purchased the PROductive subscription but still see ads or cannot access PRO features (like CSV export), you may need to restore your purchase:

Open the AccuRate app.

Go to the Settings screen (gear icon).

Tap the "Restore Purchases" button (if available) or tap the "Go PROductive" card again.

The app will check your Apple ID for existing subscriptions and unlock the features automatically. You will not be charged again.

2. How do I export my data?

CSV Export is a PRO feature.

Go to the History (Sessions) screen.

Tap the Share icon (top right corner).

Choose where you want to save or send your CSV file (e.g., Save to Files, Email, AirDrop).

3. I forgot to stop the timer. Can I edit a session?

Currently, sessions cannot be edited after they are saved. We are working on an "Edit Session" feature which will be available in the next update.

For now, you can delete the incorrect session and start a new one, or manually track the difference.

4. How is the "Earned Money" calculated?

The app calculates your earnings using the formula:
Elapsed Time (Hours) × Hourly Rate = Total Earnings

The calculation happens in real-time, down to the second.

5. Why do I see ads?

AccuRate is a free-to-use app supported by advertisements.
To remove ads and unlock unlimited session history, you can upgrade to AccuRate PRO via the Settings screen.

6. How do I delete my data?

All your session data is stored securely on your device (and in the cloud if you are logged in).

To delete a specific session: (Feature coming soon in v1.1).

To delete all data: Simply uninstalling the app will remove local data. If you wish to request a complete deletion of any cloud-associated data, please contact us at the email above.
